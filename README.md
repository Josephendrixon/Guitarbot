This Started as a guitar project for a right-handed guitar, as in only right hand.
We want to make a robot that presses down guitar strings using motors allowing someone to play chords using a foot pedal.
The plan was for a joystick foot pedal allowing 8 positions and therefore 8 Chords.
Using the Nashville numbering system, we want to map it for the keys C, D, E, F, G.
I also want to map other common chord progressions and songs and make it customizeable so other people can too.

Right now I'm trying to create a midi guitar to figure out the logic and it might replace the motor project.

In order to run the code, you need a virtual midi insturment (LoopBe1) and a Digital Audio Workspace or DAW (MuseScore)
